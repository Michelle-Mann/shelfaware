Summary
This project comes a few days late of submittal for week #2 for the summer 2024 Headstarter Ai Fellowship.

My application is a web-based pantry inventory system that allows users to store the contents of their pantry for use and more! Users can add items to their pantry, refrigerator or freezer, 
They can search for items they think they may have. And then can use those items with ease! 

I think I bit off wayyyy more than I could chew on this one! But I'm proud to say I stuck it out and I finished and I now have something I'm really stinking proud of!

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: ðŸ˜­ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸ’€

Application Features
The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- I set up a Next.js project with Material UI components
- I implemented a Firebase backend for data storage
- I created a form to add, delete and update pantry items
- I added a search or filter functionality to easily find items (I have several due to my split pantry set-up)
- I created a presentable frontend design to display all pantry items
- I deployed to Vercel and used CI/CD 

The following STRETCH features are implemented:
- I added Google authentication tokens to my site - allowing users to own their own pantry and images.

Here are some future features I'd like to add:
- Storage and maintenance of a shopping list.
- Adding the ability to manage expiration dates
- Sorting items by food type (grains, dairy, veggies etc.)
- A backlog of actions available for the user (so they can track metrics on their food consumption etc.)
